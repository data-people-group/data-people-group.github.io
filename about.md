This research blog centers on the design and development of next-generation data infrastructure that is intelligent, usable, and efficient. We believe that advances in Generative AI, coupled with human-centered design and data management principles are key to a fluid experience with data, for application developers, data analysts and scientists, and end-users alike.  

Fundamentally, our emphasis is on making _people_ more effective with _data_. 

We're affiliated with the [Data Systems and Foundations Group](https://dsf.berkeley.edu/), [Human Computer Interaction Group](https://hci.berkeley.edu/), as well as the [Effective Programming, Interaction, and Computation with Data (EPIC) Lab](https://epic.berkeley.edu/), all at the University of California, Berkeley.
