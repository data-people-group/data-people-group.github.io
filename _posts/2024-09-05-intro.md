Hello! Welcome to the Data People Research blog! 

We're a group of multi-disciplinary 
researchers at UC Berkeley who are exploring the frontiers of 
what data infrastructure should look like in the next decade, 
by making it more intelligent, intuitive, efficient, and scalable. 

We believe Large Language Models (LLMs) will play a key role in how people work
with and leverage data at hand, but we also know that LLMs 
will only take you so far, and fundamental principles from human-computer interaction
and data management will be essential in closing the gap.

Fundamentally, our emphasis is on making _people_ more effective with _data_. So, we're _data people_.

We're affiliated with 
the [Data Systems and Foundations Group](https://dsf.berkeley.edu/), 
[Human Computer Interaction Group](https://hci.berkeley.edu/), 
as well as with the 
[Effective Programming, Interaction, and Computation with Data (EPIC) Lab](https://epic.berkeley.edu/), 
all at the University of California, Berkeley.
